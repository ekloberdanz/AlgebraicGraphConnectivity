# AlgebraicGraphConnectivity

Convex optimization techniques can be applied to many problems.
In this exercise we investigated algebraic connectivity of graphs. First, we formu-
lated the problem of finding edge weights that maximize algebraic connectivity
as a convex optimization problem. And second, we used a numerical example
to calculate and compare the algebraic connectivity of a graph with optimal
edge weights versus uniform constant edge weights. We concluded that opti-
mal edge weights lead to better algebraic connectivity, because important edges
carry greater weight and therefore, significantly improve the overall graph con-
nectivity. Using this numerical example we demonstrated that greater number
of edges does not necessarily lead to greater algebraic connectivity - instead,
optimal edge weights are more important.
